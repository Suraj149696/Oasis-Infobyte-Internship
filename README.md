Task 1: xploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data


In this project, the goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover patterns and insights that can help the business make informed decisions. The project involves several key tasks:

1.Data Loading and Cleaning: Load and preprocess the dataset, ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis.

2.Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand the dataset's central tendencies and variability.

3.Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time to identify any seasonal patterns or long-term trends.

4.Customer and Product Analysis: Explore customer demographics and purchasing behavior, analyzing how different customer segments interact with various products.

5.Visualization: Create visualizations, including bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps, to effectively communicate insights from the data.

6.Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to improve business strategies, such as pricing, inventory management, and marketing.

The project offers an opportunity to gain practical experience in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, while developing skills for interpreting and presenting data-driven insights.
